 # TESTING OUR A.I.
 
 Now that we understand the usage and the basic process of
 creating an A.I., let's test the robot that we just created!

 We will need get out of our lab, and explore a apple farm,
 because its time to see if the robot that we crated, is
 working.

Feel free to use the magnifier on the robot's hand to count
all the apples, and remove all the bugs.
 
 - Note: Your challenge now is to remove all the bugs and count all the apples. Good Luck!
