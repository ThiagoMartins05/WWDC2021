 # Let's Give some commands to our A.I.
 

 Now that our robot knows the objects that it must recognize,
 and the ones that it must ignore, We need to tell it what to
 do on each case, if it recognizes an apple, a bug or a
 negative case.
 
 - Note: Remember, the main functionality that we defined on the last section, and teach the robot by connection the object to it's respective function.
