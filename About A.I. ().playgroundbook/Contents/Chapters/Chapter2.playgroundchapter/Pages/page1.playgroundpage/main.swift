 # Let's train our A.I.
 
 Now that we know what is an A.I., we can try to create ours!
 Let's create a robot A.I. based, that helps apple farmers.
 
 
 Its main functions will be count the number of apples in a tree and remove some bugs if necessary...
 
 The firs step to build our A.I. is to train it,
 To train an A.I., means to teach it to see the object that we want it to detect, and sometime teach it what not to see.
 On our case, we will teach the A.I. the positive and negative cases,
 So,
 ### if it asks for a bug -> You give a bug
 ### if it asks for a apple -> You give a apple
 ### if it asks for a negative -> You must add anything that isn't on the previous cases, and things that we don't want that the robot recognizes (on our situation, the negatives can be flowers and leaves)

 - Note: To give something to the robot, you can just drag the object to it.
